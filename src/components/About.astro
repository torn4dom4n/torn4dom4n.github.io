      Hello humans,
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-sm font-light lg:text-xl">
      My name is Long Nhat Nguyen. Music and photography have always been my
      passions, filling my life with joy and creativity. Recently, I have
      discovered an interest in programming that has captivated me. Although my
      knowledge in programming is limited, I find great enjoyment in exploring
      this fascinating field.
